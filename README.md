# Kalki CTF

Welcome to the Kalki Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge, crafted by **@rezydev**. Can you claim the ultimate victory and **Root** this vulnerable box?

## Download

Get started by downloading the **Kalki - Ubuntu Server 22 Virtual Machine image from [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/h9kvav1gtcgiwtx/Kalki+-+Ubuntu+Server+22.ova/file).**

## Instructions

1.  Start the VM and use the credentials `ip-view:ip-view` to access the VM's IP address (use `ip a` command).
2.  Ensure both your attacker and target boxes are on the same NAT Network. If not, refer to this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdAiel6KYCQ).
3.  This CTF involves a variety of challenges including web exploits, OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence), brute force attacks, hash cracking, and privilege escalation from the user `vishnu` to `root`.

## Note(s)

-   **Security Precaution**: Use the `ip-view:ip-view` credential ONLY to obtain the VM's IP address. Do NOT employ this user for any enumeration or file inspection within the box.
-   **Virtualization Platform**: Ensure you're using **VirtualBox** to run the VM. If you prefer using VMWare, it might work smoothly there too, although it hasn't been tested extensively.
